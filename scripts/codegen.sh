# This script generates code and TypeScript types for GraphQL queries
# using the schema (from Commons) and the graphql query files in this project.
#
# Inputs:
# - /server/graphql/schema.graphql
# - /app/graphql/fragments/*.graphql
# - /app/graphql/queries/*.graphql
# Outputs:
# - /app/graphql/types.ts
#
# The script will fail if there are any diffs, so it can be used for testing.
# This clones the Commons repo, so you'll need the ssh keys to do that.
